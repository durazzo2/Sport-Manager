## Admin Access

### Using the Seeded Test Accounts

After running `php artisan migrate --seed`, two test accounts are available:

| Role     | Email             | Password   | Access     |
|----------|-------------------|------------|------------|
| Admin    | admin@test.com    | password   | `/admin`   |
| Customer | user@test.com     | password   | Frontend   |

### Creating a New Admin User

To create a fresh admin user with access to the `/admin` dashboard:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-user
```

Follow the prompts to enter a name, email, and password. This creates a user with admin panel access.

To grant the `super_admin` role (full permissions including managing other admins' facilities):

```bash
php artisan tinker
```

```php
$user = \App\Models\User::where('email', 'your@email.com')->first();
$user->assignRole('super_admin');
```
